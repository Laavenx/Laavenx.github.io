    <h2>Some of the things that I've implemented:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed a system which makes it possible for a writer to be able to create their own dialogues. I accomplished this by creating a FRowType which can hold Text, SoundWave and character portrait as Texture2D.
            This then can be loaded sequentially using DataTable by the Dialogue UI Blueprint.</li>
        <li>Changed Turn Based System to give priority of action consecutively for example: player takes action with all of their units and then enemy does the same.</li>
        <li>Player being able to freely pick which unit to take action with during consecutive turns.</li>
        <li>Implemented combat stats and calculations according to GDD</li>
    </ul>
