    <h1>Retro Test</h1>
    A project developed to demonstrate creation of 3D platformer using GAS and custom movement in UE5.

    <ul>
        <li>Custom MovementComponent changes gravity based on timeline curve per tick, for jumping and falling.</li>
        <li>Player input is checked for preemtive jump input, to perform auto-jump so that player can chain jumps more easily</li>
        <li>Array of Structs storing angle and magnitude, determines how consecutive jumps behave.</li>
        <li>Adding impulse is done using MultiCast RPC to keep it in sync with the server</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>AttributeSet keeps track of received damage and responds accordinly applying knockback or destroying the owner</li>
        <li>Array of Structs storing angle and magnitude, determines how consecutive jumps behave.</li>
        <li>Adding impulse and changing gravity is done using MultiCast RPC to keep it in sync with the server</li>
        <li>Movement and rotation of platforms are replicated using RPC called on server which uses MoveComponentTo (Interpolates the movement)</li>
