    <h1>Samsara Saga</h1>
    Upcoming mmorpg unreal engine 5 game, that I'm working on currently.
    <br><br>
    I'am working on modifying our own fork of <a href="https://github.com/Dartanlla/OWS">OWS</a> server and plugin in C# and C++, for our own needs and generally on implementation of mmorpg gameplay systems using unreal Replication and GAS.
    The game uses Paper2D sprites which are manually rotated towards camera, they have 8 axis direction.

    OWS plugin allows us to automatically create instances of dedicated server, and to setup and communicate with Database. In this project it was my first time using dedicated server and there are interesting quirks
     whicht show up
    when you use it instead of just testing the game on Client mode. For example we have DamagaText widgets, and they get created from a widget blueprint on the server, while this
    works on unreal client mode, the dedicated server doesn't see blueprint associated with that widget and the widget doesn't get created.
    <br><br>
    <h2>Some things I've implemented:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Setup character Paper2D sprites to have separate body and head (head gets attached to socket) so that we can rotate them separately.</li>
        <li>Implement target selection.</li>
        <li>Picking up mob drops.</li>
        <li>Implement OWS features like login and portals</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    It is difficult to work with replication, my current strategy is to check what is happening inside of a function with HasAuthority() or GetNetMode().
    I have to maintain OWS fork, because we want new features from main branch. That includes fixing queries and merging incompatible code. 
    Unreal has issues with not updating binary files sometimes and its not uncommon for me to re-launch a dedicated server in dev, to find out that it's using old code.

    Sample of character sprite (not completed) and basic combat + picking up items.
