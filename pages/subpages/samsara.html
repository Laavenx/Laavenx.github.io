    <h1>Samsara Saga</h1>
    Upcoming mmorpg unreal engine 5 game, that I'm working on currently.
    <br><br>
    I'am working on modifying OWS2 server and plugin in C# and C++, for our own needs and generally on implementation of mmorpg systems using unreal Replication and GAS.
    The game uses Paper2D sprites which are manually rotated towards camera, they have 8 axis direction.

    This project has a pretty big scope, so teamwork and work organization is really important for efficiency sake.
    To accomplish that efficiency it is essential to employ tools such as Miro or similar for managing tasks for each team.
    I'am managing tasks and reviewing code according to Unreal Engine standards for the dev team.
