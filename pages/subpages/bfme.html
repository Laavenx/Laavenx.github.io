    <h1>BFME Reforged</h1>
    BFME Reforged is a Fan project that I used to contribute to.
    It is a Unreal Engine RTS game incorporating base building, unit production and combat.
    <br><br>
    I have learned Unreal Engine to be able to contribute to this project and then I progressed to solving more complex problems.
    <br><br>
    This game is written to support thousands of units at 60fps. I have spent a lot of time figuring out how to
    utilize unreal systems to be able to do so. The units work similary to boids, their actions are dynamically calculated
    in the mass system using a set of modular "rules" for each entity.

    One of the bigger things I've managed to solve is how to generate a 2d collision ( Units work on a 2D plane ) for entities,
    to make it cheaper.
    I've done so by taking all of the vertices of a 3D entity, clamping a range and removing all unneeded
    vertices and then using 2D convex hull alghoritm to trim all the innermost points.
    Produced 2D polygon can be shrunk or expanded by using imported part of Clipper2 library.
    All of it is configurable within editor.

    I've collaborated with an audio designer by creating an easy way for him to add different sounds to an entity.
