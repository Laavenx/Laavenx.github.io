    Hi, I’m Mateusz an Unreal Engine Developer and passionate programmer from Poland.
    I’m currently developing a turn-based strategy game in my free time.

    <br>
    <br>
    I specialize in programming gameplay logic using both C++ and Blueprints, but I also enjoy working with AI and multiplayer systems.
     Video games have been a huge part of my life for over 13 years, and I see them as the highest form of art.
     My goal is to contribute to the gaming industry by working on games that bring others the same joy I’ve experienced.
    I have a strong passion for strategy games, including subgenres like 4X, RTS, Tower Defense, and Auto-Battlers, although I've also played a lot of
    RPG games.
